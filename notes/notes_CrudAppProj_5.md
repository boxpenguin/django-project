# Chapter 3 Part 5: "Creating First View and Template"
## Notes setup
Video titles should be double quoted and in a `##` header

    ## Video "Thing"

Notes should follow with a `###` header along with new sections of code discussion. Like when editing a different file but within the same video / area.

    ### Moved to folder/file.ext inside of video "Thing"

Use the `>` block quote to reference which file is being edited.

    > My Example code: folder/file.ext
